## What is Jolt?

Jolt is a Nostr client that brings back the simplicity and charm of early social media. It uses the decentralized Nostr protocol, which means:

- **You own your identity** - Your cryptographic keys give you true ownership
- **No company controls your account** - Your keys work across all Nostr apps
- **Censorship resistant** - No central authority can ban or silence you
- **NO crypto/Bitcoin features** - Just pure social networking (zaps/lightning hidden)
- **Free to host** - No backend, no database, no costs

## Features

✅ **2007 Twitter Aesthetic**
- Light blue (#9AE4E8) theme matching original Twitter
- Table-based layout with classic typography
- Nostalgic user experience

✅ **Core Functionality**
- Generate Nostr key pairs securely
- Login with existing nsec keys
- Post sparks (280 characters max)
- Image uploads with alt text support (paste or upload)
- Real-time timeline with client-side filtering
- Clickable posts with shareable URLs (`/post.html?id=...`)
- Threaded conversations with reply chains
- Replies and favorites (kind 7 reactions)
- Notifications tab for mentions and interactions
- User profiles with custom backgrounds (`/profile.html?npub=...`)
- Edit profile (name, bio, avatar, display name, website)
- Follow/unfollow users (kind 3 contact lists)
- Hashtag pages (`/hashtag.html?tag=...`)
- Search users by npub, NIP-05 address, name, or bio (`/search.html`)
- Search Sparks with toggle between Jolt-only and all Nostr notes
- Settings page with filter controls (crypto filtering, reply hiding, client filtering)
- Low Data Mode (disables auto-loading images, reduces requests)
- Emoji support via Twemoji

✅ **Performance Features**
- **Hybrid caching architecture**: Server-side cache for global data (60s TTL), client-side cache for user data
- **Low Data Mode**: Reduces bandwidth usage by ~70% - images load only on click, fewer background requests
- **Smart search**: Server cache for user search, direct relay queries as fallback
- **Rate limiting**: In Low Data Mode, reduces relay polling frequency
- **Adaptive loading**: Balances server cache, client cache, and direct relay queries based on data type

✅ **Security First**
- Keys generated client-side only
- Secure key storage warnings during signup
- No backend servers - fully decentralized

## Getting Started

### Running Locally

**Option 1: Static Server (Development)**
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# or
npm run dev
```
Open: http://localhost:8000

**Option 2: Node Server with Caching (Recommended)**
```bash
npm install
npm start
```
Open: http://localhost:3000

The Node server provides:
- Faster timeline loading (server-side caching)
- Security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options)
- API endpoint for Jolt posts
- Better performance for production

### Deploying as a Web App

Jolt can be deployed in two ways: **static hosting** (free) or **VPS hosting** (better performance).

#### Option 1: Free Static Hosting

Deploy the frontend only - all Nostr communication happens client-side.

**Vercel (Recommended):**
```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel
```
- Automatic HTTPS
- Global CDN
- Zero config needed
- Deploy in <1 minute

**Netlify:**
```bash
npm install -g netlify-cli
netlify deploy --prod
```
- Drag & drop deployment available
- Custom domains supported
- Automatic HTTPS

**GitHub Pages:**
```bash
# Push your code
git push origin main

# Enable Pages in repository settings
# Settings → Pages → Source: main branch
```
- 100% free
- Perfect for personal projects
- Custom domain supported

**Cloudflare Pages:**
1. Go to [pages.cloudflare.com](https://pages.cloudflare.com)
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Build command: *(leave empty)*
4. Output directory: `/`
- Unlimited bandwidth
- Global CDN
- Fast deployment

See [HOSTING.md](HOSTING.md) for detailed step-by-step guides for all platforms.

#### Option 2: VPS Hosting (Recommended for Production)

Deploy with Node.js server for better performance and server-side caching.

**Quick Deploy:**
```bash
# 1. Install Node.js 20+
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt install -y nodejs

# 2. Clone and setup
git clone <your-repo>
cd jolt
npm install

# 3. Start server
npm start
# Server runs on http://localhost:3000
```

**Production Setup with PM2:**
```bash
# Install PM2 for process management
npm install -g pm2

# Start Jolt
pm2 start server.js --name jolt

# Auto-restart on boot
pm2 startup
pm2 save
```

**Nginx Reverse Proxy:**
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name yourdomain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}
```

**SSL with Let's Encrypt:**
```bash
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
sudo certbot --nginx -d yourdomain.com
```

**Minimum VPS Requirements:**
- **CPU:** 1 vCPU
- **RAM:** 2GB minimum (4GB recommended)
- **Storage:** 10GB SSD
- **OS:** Ubuntu 20.04+ or Debian 11+
- **Network:** 1TB bandwidth/month

**Recommended VPS Providers:**
- [DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com) - $6/month Droplet
- [Hetzner](https://hetzner.com) - €4.51/month CX11
- [Linode](https://linode.com) - $5/month Nanode
- [Vultr](https://vultr.com) - $5/month instance

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for complete production setup including:
- Systemd service configuration
- Nginx configuration
- SSL/HTTPS setup
- Environment variables
- Monitoring and logs
- Backup strategies

#### Deployment Comparison

| Feature | Static Hosting | VPS Hosting |
|---------|---------------|-------------|
| **Cost** | Free | $5-10/month |
| **Setup Time** | <5 minutes | ~30 minutes |
| **Server-side caching** | ❌ | ✅ (60s TTL) |
| **Search API** | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Custom relays** | Client-side only | Server + Client |
| **Performance** | Good | Excellent |
| **Bandwidth** | Unlimited (CDN) | Limited by VPS |
| **Global CDN** | ✅ | ❌ (single region) |
| **Automatic HTTPS** | ✅ | Manual (Let's Encrypt) |
| **Best for** | Personal use | Production/high traffic |

**Our Recommendation:**
- **Starting out?** Use Vercel/Netlify for free static hosting
- **Growing user base?** Migrate to VPS for better caching and performance
- **High traffic?** VPS + CDN (Cloudflare) for best results

### Caching Strategy

**Server-side cache (60s TTL):**
- Global Jolt posts timeline
- User metadata (kind 0 events)
- User timelines
- Search results (user queries)

**Client-side (localStorage):**
- User keys (nsec/npub)
- Settings and filters
- Media preferences
- Custom relay lists

**Direct relay queries:**
- Real-time notifications
- Individual post lookups
- Follow list updates
- User-specific searches in Low Data Mode

## Nostr Events Used

- **Kind 0:** User metadata (name, about, picture, display_name, website, banner)
- **Kind 1:** Text notes (sparks)
- **Kind 3:** Follow lists (contact lists)
- **Kind 7:** Reactions/favorites (+/- content)

## Roadmap

- [x] Basic posting and timeline
- [x] User profiles with editing
- [x] Follow/unfollow system
- [x] Reply functionality
- [x] Favorites (reactions)
- [x] User profile pages
- [x] Hashtag support
- [x] Notifications (mentions)
- [x] Settings page with filters
- [x] Image uploads
- [x] Search functionality (users by npub/NIP-05/name/bio, Sparks)
- [x] Low Data Mode for bandwidth savings
- [ ] Direct messages (NIP-04)
- [ ] Mute/block users
- [ ] Lists and communities
- [ ] Advanced search filters (date range, specific users)

## Privacy & Security

### 🔐 Zero-Knowledge Architecture

**Private Keys (nsec):**
- Generated in browser using `crypto.getRandomValues()`
- **NEVER transmitted** to any server
- Stored ONLY in browser localStorage
- All Nostr events signed client-side
- Server has **zero access** to keys

**What the Server Knows:**
- Nothing about your keys
- Nothing about your sessions
- Only caches PUBLIC Jolt posts (read-only)

**Security Measures:**
- Content Security Policy headers
- X-Frame-Options: DENY (prevent clickjacking)
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- HTTPS required in production
- No eval(), strict script sources
- Input sanitization (XSS protection)

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for complete security architecture.

**User Responsibilities:**
- Backup your nsec (we cannot recover it)
- Never share your private key
- Use HTTPS sites only
- Clear browser data on public computers
